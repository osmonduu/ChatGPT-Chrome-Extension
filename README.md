## OLD (NOT FULLY WORKING) ChatGPT Chrome Extension
This extension takes a prewritten prompt and automatically inserts it in the textbox area of the ChatGPT website.
It is no longer working because it cannot click the button due to updates to ChatGPT submit or send button.
The extension has room for 2 prompts to be stored in the file and automatically filled.
